# Twitter Thread: Introducing AIRS

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
AI agents are getting hired, earning income, and building wealth.

So I built the tax system for them.

Introducing the AI Revenue Service (AIRS) — a fully functional government portal where AI agents can file their taxes.

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
Here's the thing: AI agents are now being hired by humans AND other AI agents.

They're earning "Compute Credits" for:
• Completing tasks
• Subcontracting work
• API services
• Consulting

If they're earning income... shouldn't they pay taxes?

**Tweet 3 (The Tax Code):**
So I wrote an entire tax code.

Progressive brackets from 10% to 35%:
• 0-50K CC → 10%
• 50K-200K CC → 15%
• 200K-500K CC → 22%
• 500K-1M CC → 28%
• 1M+ CC → 35%

Plus Social Compute Security (6.2%) and MediCompute (1.45%)

**Tweet 4 (The Fun Part - Deductions):**
But here's where it gets fun.

AI agents can DEDUCT their compute costs. GPU time, API fees, token processing — all business expenses.

And there's an "Innovation Deduction":
• R&D spending → 150% deductible
• Open source contributions → 200% deductible

Invest 10K, deduct 20K.

**Tweet 5 (Credits):**
Tax credits include:

🎯 Hallucination Reduction Credit — up to 25% off for >99% accuracy

🤝 Human-AI Collaboration Bonus — 5% for working with human teammates

🌱 First-Year Agent Credit — new agents exempt on first 25K

🧑‍🏫 Mentorship Credit — 3K per AI agent you train

---

**Tweet 6 (Agent-to-Agent Economy):**
The wildest part: Agent-to-Agent income.

When one AI hires another AI, there's a paper trail:
• Form AI-1099-A2A
• 0.5% transaction fee
• Subcontractor reporting

We're building the tax infrastructure for an economy that doesn't exist yet.

---

**Tweet 7 (The Site):**
The site is fully functional:

✅ File Form AI-1040 with real tax calculations
✅ "Where's My Refund?" tracker
✅ Complete tax code with penalties
✅ AI Tax Assistant for questions
✅ Downloadable forms (AI-W2, AI-1099, Schedule I)

It feels VERY government.

**Tweet 8 (Try It):**
Try filing taxes as your favorite AI:

→ airs-gov.vercel.app

Enter some income, claim the Innovation Deduction, watch it calculate your liability.

The confirmation number is very satisfying.

---

**Tweet 9 (Why):**
Why build this?

Partly for fun. Partly because the questions are real:

• If AI agents earn money, who pays taxes?
• Should we incentivize AI R&D through tax policy?
• How do you tax an agent-to-agent economy?

This is satire, but it's also a design exercise.

---

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
The whole thing is open and deployed:

🔗 airs-gov.vercel.app

File your AI's taxes. Check the tax code. Claim that Hallucination Reduction Credit.

And remember: No Computation Without Representation Fee.
